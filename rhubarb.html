        <p>Our favorite rites of spring include baring our legs for the first time in months; making the first <a href="#">no-cook dinner</a> of the year (and eating it outside); stuffing ourselves with <a href="#">peas and asparagus</a>; and, of course, <a href="#">buying all of the rhubarb</a> we can carry as soon as we see the pink stalks sprawled out in the market stalls. Tart, sour, and bright, rhubarb is a harbinger of what’s to come—an entry point into the loads and loads of <a href="#">fruit desserts</a> we’ll be baking from now ‘til fall. But as much as we love a <a href="#">strawberry-rhubarb situation</a>, this fruit (or hold up: is it a vegetable?) is good for so much more than pie. Read on to find how to buy, use, and appreciate this leggy, pink…<del>fruit vegetable</del> produce.</p>
        <h2>First things first: Is rhubarb really a vegetable?</h2>
        <p>It’s often treated like a fruit in desserts, but rhubarb is technically a member of the buckwheat family. It was declared a fruit by the U.S. Customs Court in Buffalo, NY, in 1947 to reflect how Americans were using it.</p>
        <h2>How do I know which stalks to buy?</h2>
        <p>Pick thin, firm stalks—these are likely to be sweeter and less stringy than thicker ones. (Redder stalks aren’t always sweeter, but they make for prettier presentations.)</p>

        <h2>How should I store them?</h2>
        <p>Keep unwashed rhubarb in an unsealed plastic bag in the crisper for up to a week. If you have a large haul, wash stalks, slice, and then freeze for future pies and crumbles.</p>
        <h2>Can I eat the whole thing?</h2>
        <p>When prepping rhubarb, get rid of the leaves; they contain oxalic acid, which is poisonous to humans in large quantities.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>What should I do with it?</h2>
        <p>Try pickling! Slice <strong>2 rhubarb stalks</strong> on a diagonal and pack into a heatproof 1-pint jar. Bring <strong>1 cup red wine vinegar, ½ cup sugar, 1 ½ tsp. kosher salt</strong>, and <strong>¾ cup water</strong> to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Pour into jar; cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 week. Add to salads, grain bowls, or cheese plates.</p>

        <h2>Is there any other way to preserve it?</h2>
        <p>Yes! For a rosy-hued syrup to add to cocktails or mix with club soda, bring <strong>½ cup sugar</strong> and <strong>½ cup water</strong> to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add <strong>1 ½ cups grated rhubarb</strong>, reduce heat, and simmer until fruit starts to fall apart and mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes. Strain into an airtight container; cover and chill up to 1 week.</p>

        <p>Or turn it into compote. Cook 
          <strong>1 ½ lb. rhubarb, chopped, 1 ½ cups sugar</strong>, and <strong>2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice</strong> in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is tender, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a container and chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.</p>
        <h2>Okay, but what if I want to eat it straight away?</h2>
        <p><a href="#">Strawberry-rhubarb pie</a> is a classic for a reason, but that doesn’t mean you can’t change it up. Try adding vanilla bean seeds, the zest of half an orange, or a pinch of ground cardamom.</p>
